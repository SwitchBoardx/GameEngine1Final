# GameEngine1Final
-----
SETUP
-----
First, clone the repository onto your computer. Second, create a Unreal Project named "GameEngine1Final". After pulling all the content from github, copy and paste Config, 
Content, Saved, Source (if there yet), and GameEngine1Final project file into your own project folder that you just created. 
Usually in C:\Users\(YOUR USER)\Documents\UnrealProjects. After copy and pasting open your project and everything should work out!

-------------------------
PUTTING STUFF ONTO GITHUB
-------------------------

Go to the Unreal Projects folder. Copy Config, Content, Saved, Source (if there yet), and GameEngine1Final Project file into the
cloned GitHub folder. Commit the changes within GitHub with a title and description of work done. Hitting SYNC should push the files
to the repo online. I prefer to use Git bash to push it myself since sometimes SYNC does no like to work.
